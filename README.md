# Basic-Website-using-HTML5-CSS3
This is a basic HTML site I made as part of a project portfolio. It has a very minimal design structure and a few basic protocols.
I will improve it incrementally as I go.
This is my very first attempt in creating a site and I will still need to integrate a framework in future releases.
-----Will add an interactive chatbot alluding to the nature and my intent for this site going forward----
